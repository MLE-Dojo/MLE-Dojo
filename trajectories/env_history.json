          "overview": "### Description\n\nDive into the Random Acts of Pizza competition, where participants will harness machine learning to predict the success of pizza requests made on Reddit. With a dataset of 5,671 requests, each accompanied by its outcome (successful or unsuccessful) and relevant meta-data, the challenge is to develop an algorithm that can accurately forecast which requests will receive a pizza. \n\nThis competition, hosted by Kaggle, is designed for the machine learning community to engage in a fun and practical exercise. The dataset, collected by Althoff et al., provides a unique opportunity to explore the dynamics of altruistic requests. \n\n### Evaluation\n\nSubmissions are evaluated on area under the ROC curve between the predicted probability that a request will get pizza and the observed outcomes.\n\n## Submission File\n\nFor each request in the test set, you should predict a real-valued probability that it resulted in a pizza. The file should contain a header and have the following format:\n\n```\nrequest_id,requester_received_pizza\nt3_i8iy4,0\nt3_1mfqi0,0\nt3_lclka,0\n...\n...\n```\n\n### Dataset Description\n\nThis dataset includes 5,671 requests collected from the Reddit community Random Acts of Pizza between December 8, 2010, and September 29, 2013.
