### Description

Join Prudential, a leading life insurance issuer in the USA, as we seek innovative data scientists to tackle complex challenges and uncover new opportunities within our newly-formed Data Science group. With a legacy of 140 years, we aim to revolutionize the antiquated life insurance application process, which currently deters potential customers due to its lengthy and cumbersome nature. 

The challenge lies in developing a predictive model that automates risk classification and eligibility assessment, significantly reducing the time and effort required for customers to obtain quotes while ensuring their privacy. By enhancing the understanding of data points in our existing assessments, your contributions can reshape public perception of the life insurance industry and improve customer engagement.

### Evaluation

Submissions are scored based on the quadratic weighted kappa, which measures the agreement between two ratings. This metric typically varies from 0 (random agreement) to 1 (complete agreement). In the event that there is less agreement between the raters than expected by chance, this metric may go below 0.

The response variable has 8 possible ratings. Each application is characterized by a tuple (ea,eb), which corresponds to its scores by Rater A (actual risk) and Rater B (predicted risk). The quadratic weighted kappa is calculated as follows.

First, an N x N histogram matrix O is constructed, such that Oi,j corresponds to the number of applications that received a rating i by A and a rating j by B. An N-by-N matrix of weights, w, is calculated based on the difference between raters' scores:

w_{i,j} = \frac{\left(i-j\right)^2}{\left(N-1\right)^2}

An N-by-N histogram matrix of expected ratings, E, is calculated, assuming that there is no correlation between rating scores. This is calculated as the outer product between each rater's histogram vector of ratings, normalized such that E and O have the same sum.

From these three matrices, the quadratic weighted kappa is calculated as:

\kappa=1-\frac{\sum_{i,j}w_{i,j}O_{i,j}}{\sum_{i,j}w_{i,j}E_{i,j}}.

## Submission File

For each Id in the test set, you must predict the Response variable. The file should contain a header and have the following format:

```
Id,Response
1,4
3,8
4,3
etc.
```

### Dataset Description

In this dataset, you are provided over a hundred variables describing attributes of life insurance applicants. The task is to predict the "Response" variable for each Id in the test set. "Response" is an ordinal measure of risk that has 8 levels.

| Id | A unique identifier associated with an application. |
| Product_Info_1-7 | A set of normalized variables relating to the product applied for |
| Ins_Age | Normalized age of applicant |
| Ht | Normalized height of applicant |
| Wt | Normalized weight of applicant |
| BMI | Normalized BMI of applicant |
| Employment_Info_1-6 | A set of normalized variables relating to the employment history of the applicant. |
| InsuredInfo_1-6 | A set of normalized variables providing information about the applicant. |
| Insurance_History_1-9 | A set of normalized variables relating to the insurance history of the applicant. |
| Family_Hist_1-5 | A set of normalized variables relating to the family history of the applicant. |
| Medical_History_1-41 | A set of normalized variables relating to the medical history of the applicant. |
| Medical_Keyword_1-48 | A set of dummy variables relating to the presence of/absence of a medical keyword being associated with the application. |
| Response | This is the target variable, an ordinalÂ variable relating to the final decision associated with an application |

The following variables are all categorical (nominal):

Product_Info_1, Product_Info_2, Product_Info_3, Product_Info_5, Product_Info_6, Product_Info_7, Employment_Info_2, Employment_Info_3, Employment_Info_5, InsuredInfo_1, InsuredInfo_2, InsuredInfo_3, InsuredInfo_4, InsuredInfo_5, InsuredInfo_6, InsuredInfo_7, Insurance_History_1, Insurance_History_2, Insurance_History_3, Insurance_History_4, Insurance_History_7, Insurance_History_8, Insurance_History_9, Family_Hist_1, Medical_History_2, Medical_History_3, Medical_History_4, Medical_History_5, Medical_History_6, Medical_History_7, Medical_History_8, Medical_History_9, Medical_History_11, Medical_History_12, Medical_History_13, Medical_History_14, Medical_History_16, Medical_History_17, Medical_History_18, Medical_History_19, Medical_History_20, Medical_History_21, Medical_History_22, Medical_History_23, Medical_History_25, Medical_History_26, Medical_History_27, Medical_History_28, Medical_History_29, Medical_History_30, Medical_History_31, Medical_History_33, Medical_History_34, Medical_History_35, Medical_History_36, Medical_History_37, Medical_History_38, Medical_History_39, Medical_History_40, Medical_History_41

The following variables are continuous:

Product_Info_4, Ins_Age, Ht, Wt, BMI, Employment_Info_1, Employment_Info_4, Employment_Info_6, Insurance_History_5, Family_Hist_2, Family_Hist_3, Family_Hist_4, Family_Hist_5

The following variables are discrete:

Medical_History_1, Medical_History_10, Medical_History_15, Medical_History_24, Medical_History_32

Medical_Keyword_1-48 are dummy variables.
