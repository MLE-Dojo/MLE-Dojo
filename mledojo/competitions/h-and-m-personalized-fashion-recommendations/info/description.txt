### Description

H&M Group, a global family of brands with 53 online markets and around 4,850 stores, aims to enhance the shopping experience through effective product recommendations. With a vast selection of products, customers often struggle to find what they want, which can lead to missed purchases. By improving recommendations, H&M not only boosts sales but also promotes sustainability by reducing returns and transportation emissions.

In this competition, participants are challenged to create product recommendations using data from past transactions, customer metadata, and product metadata. The dataset includes various types of information, from basic details like garment type and customer age to more complex text and image data. There are no restrictions on the methods used, allowing for exploration of categorical algorithms, NLP, and deep learning techniques.

### Evaluation

Submissions are evaluated according to the Mean Average Precision @ 12 (MAP@12):

MAP@12 = \frac{1}{U} \sum_{u=1}^{U} \frac{1}{min(m,12)}  \sum_{k=1}^{min(n,12)} P(k) \times rel(k)

where U  is the number of customers, P(k) is the precision at cutoff k, n is the number predictions per customer, m is the number of ground truth values per customer, and rel(k) is an indicator function equaling 1 if the item at rank k is a relevant (correct) label, zero otherwise.

Notes:

- You will be making purchase predictions for all customer_id values provided, regardless of whether these customers made purchases in the training data.
- Customer that did not make any purchase during test period are excluded from the scoring.
- There is never a penalty for using the full 12 predictions for a customer that ordered fewer than 12 items; thus, it's advantageous to make 12 predictions for each customer.

## Submission File

For each customer_id observed in the training data, you may predict up to 12 labels for the article_id, which is the predicted items a customer will buy in the next 7-day period after the training time period. The file should contain a header and have the following format:

```
customer_id,prediction
00000dba,0706016001 0706016002 0372860001 ...
0000423b,0706016001 0706016002 0372860001 ...
...
```

### Dataset Description

For this challenge, you are given the purchase history of customers over time, along with supporting metadata. Your task is to predict which articles each customer will purchase in the 7-day period immediately following the training data. Customers who did not make any purchases during that time are excluded from scoring.

### Files

- images/ - a folder of images corresponding to each article_id; images are placed in subfolders starting with the first three digits of the article_id; note, not all article_id values have a corresponding image.
- articles.csv - detailed metadata for each article_id available for purchase
- customers.csv - metadata for each customer_id in the dataset
- sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format
- transactions_train.csv - the training data, consisting of the purchases each customer made on each date, along with additional information. Duplicate rows correspond to multiple purchases of the same item. Your task is to predict the article_ids each customer will purchase during the 7-day period immediately after the training data period.

NOTE: You must make predictions for all customer_id values found in the sample submission. All customers who made purchases during the test period are scored, regardless of whether they had purchase history in the training data.

### Other Important Information

There are no specific requirements mentioned, allowing participants the freedom to explore various methodologies for generating recommendations.
