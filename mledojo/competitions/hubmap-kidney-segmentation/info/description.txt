### Description

The "Hacking the Kidney" competition invites participants to contribute to the Human BioMolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP) by mapping the human kidney at single-cell resolution. With over 7 billion people and 300 billion stars in the Milky Way, understanding the 37 trillion cells in the human body is a monumental task that can significantly impact human health. This competition focuses on detecting functional tissue units (FTUs) in kidney tissue samples, defined as three-dimensional blocks of cells centered around a capillary. Participants are challenged to develop a robust glomeruli FTU detector, with the opportunity to present their findings to a panel of judges. Successful submissions will aid in constructing tools and resources to explore the relationships between cells and individual health, advancing our understanding of cell and tissue organization.

### Evaluation

This competition is evaluated on the mean Dice coefficient. The Dice coefficient can be used to compare the pixel-wise agreement between a predicted segmentation and its corresponding ground truth. The formula is given by:

\frac{2 * |X \cap Y|}{|X| + |Y|},

where X is the predicted set of pixels and Y is the ground truth. The Dice coefficient is defined to be 1 when both X and Y are empty. The leaderboard score is the mean of the Dice coefficients for each image in the test set.

## Submission File

In order to reduce the submission file size, our metric uses run-length encoding on the pixel values. Instead of submitting an exhaustive list of indices for your segmentation, you will submit pairs of values that contain a start position and a run length. E.g. '1 3' implies starting at pixel 1 and running a total of 3 pixels (1,2,3).

Note that, at the time of encoding, the mask should be binary, meaning the masks for all objects in an image are joined into a single large mask. A value of 0 should indicate pixels that are not masked, and a value of 1 will indicate pixels that are masked.

The competition format requires a space delimited list of pairs. For example, '1 3 10 5' implies pixels 1,2,3,10,11,12,13,14 are to be included in the mask. The metric checks that the pairs are sorted, positive, and the decoded pixel values are not duplicated. The pixels are numbered from top to bottom, then left to right: 1 is pixel (1,1), 2 is pixel (2,1), etc.

The file should contain a header and have the following format:

```
id,predicted
1,1 1 5 1
2,1 1
3,1 1
etc.
```

### Dataset Description

The HuBMAP data for this competition includes 11 fresh frozen and 9 Formalin Fixed Paraffin Embedded (FFPE) PAS kidney images, with glomeruli FTU annotations available for all samples. Each human kidney contains over 600,000 glomeruli, typically ranging from 100-350Î¼m in diameter. Participants are encouraged to develop segmentation algorithms to identify glomeruli in the PAS stained microscopy data, utilizing external data and pre-trained models as needed. All data and code must be released under Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0).

## The Dataset

The dataset consists of large (>500MB - 5GB) TIFF files, with 8 in the training set and 5 in the public test set. The private test set is larger than the public test set. The training set includes annotations in both RLE-encoded and unencoded (JSON) forms, denoting segmentations of glomeruli, along with anatomical structure segmentations to assist in identifying tissue parts.

## File structure

The JSON files are structured with each feature containing a type (Feature) and object type id (PathAnnotationObject), a geometry with a Polygon for the feature's volume, and additional properties like name and color. The IsLocked field indicates whether the object is a glomerulus or anatomical structure. The expected prediction for an image is an RLE-encoded mask containing all objects, with binary encoding indicating masked and non-masked pixels.

train.csv contains unique IDs for each image and an RLE-encoded representation of the mask for the objects. Further details on the RLE encoding scheme can be found in the evaluation tab.

### Other Important Information

This is a Code Competition, and submissions must be made through Notebooks. Participants can submit multiple entries, but only the latest submission before the deadline will be considered. All team members must be listed as collaborators on the submitted Notebook, and all notebooks must be made public by the submission deadline.
