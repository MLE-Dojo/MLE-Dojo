### Description

This competition invites participants to explore the intricate behaviors and cognitive processes involved in writing by analyzing keystroke log data. Writers employ various techniques for planning, revising, and managing their time, all of which can significantly impact writing quality. While traditional assessments often focus solely on the final product, this competition aims to leverage data science to uncover the relationships between writing behaviors and performance. Hosted by Vanderbilt University in collaboration with The Learning Agency Lab, the competition seeks to identify key process features from keystroke logs to predict overall writing quality. By shifting the focus from end results to the writing process itself, participants can help enhance learners' metacognitive awareness and self-regulation in writing.

### Evaluation

We use the Root Mean Squared Error to score submissions, defined as:

\textrm{RMSE} = \left(\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \widehat{y}_i)^2 \right)^{1/2}

where \widehat{y}_i is the predicted value and y_i is the original value for each instance i over n total instances.

## Submission File

For each id in the test set, you must predict the corresponding score (described on the Data page). The file should contain a header and have the following format:

```
id,score
0000aaaa,1.0
2222bbbb,2.0
4444cccc,3.0
...
```

### Dataset Description

The competition dataset consists of approximately 5000 logs capturing user inputs, including keystrokes and mouse clicks, during essay composition. Each essay is scored on a scale from 0 to 6, and the objective is to predict the score based on the corresponding log data. More details about the dataset can be found on the Data Collection Procedure page.
