### Description

Join us in the revival of the beloved Dogs vs. Cats classification challenge! Originally launched in 2013, this competition invites participants to leverage modern deep learning techniques to tackle a problem that has evolved alongside advancements in machine learning. With the introduction of Kernels and Jupyter Notebooks, sharing and collaborating on code has never been easier. This competition serves as a playground for data scientists to refine their skills on a classic dataset, preparing them for future challenges in the field.

### Evaluation

Submissions are scored on the log loss:

\textrm{LogLoss} = - \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \left[ y_i \log(\hat{y}_i) + (1 - y_i) \log(1 - \hat{y}_i)\right],

where

- n is the number of images in the test set
- \\( \hat{y}_i \\) is the predicted probability of the image being a dog
- \\( y_i \\) is 1 if the image is a dog, 0 if cat
- \\( log() \\) is the natural (base e) logarithm

A smaller log loss is better.

## Submission File

For each image in the test set, you must submit a probability that image is a dog. The file should have a header and be in the following format:

```
id,label
1,0.5
2,0.5
3,0.5
...
```

### Dataset Description

The train folder contains 25,000 images of dogs and cats, with each image labeled in the filename. The test folder includes 12,500 images, identified by a numeric ID. For each test image, you are required to predict the probability that it is a dog (1 = dog, 0 = cat).

### Files

The files included in the competition are:

- train.zip: Contains the training images.
- test.zip: Contains the test images.
- sample_submission.csv: A sample submission file format. 

### Other Important Information

Participants are encouraged to utilize the Kernels feature for sharing and collaboration.
