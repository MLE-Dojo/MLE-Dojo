### Description

Rossmann, a leading drug store chain with over 3,000 locations across 7 European countries, is inviting participants to predict daily sales for 1,115 stores in Germany over a six-week period. Store managers currently face challenges in forecasting sales due to various influencing factors such as promotions, competition, holidays, and seasonality. By developing a reliable sales prediction model, participants will empower store managers to optimize staff scheduling and enhance customer service, allowing them to focus on their core responsibilities.

### Evaluation

Submissions are evaluated on the Root Mean Square Percentage Error (RMSPE). The RMSPE is calculated as

\textrm{RMSPE} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left(\frac{y_i - \hat{y}_i}{y_i}\right)^2},

where y_i denotes the sales of a single store on a single day and yhat_i denotes the corresponding prediction. Any day and store with 0 sales is ignored in scoring.

## Submission File

The file should contain a header and have the following format:

```
Id,Sales
1,0
2,0
3,0
etc.
```
