Evaluation  
Submissions are evaluated on area under the ROC curve between the predicted probability and the observed target.

Submission File  
For each id in the test set, you must predict the probability for the target variable smoking. The file should contain a header and have the following format:

```
id,smoking
159256,0.5
159257,0.5
159258,0.5
etc.
```

Dataset Description  
The dataset for this competition (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model trained on the Smoker Status Prediction using Bio-Signals dataset. Feature distributions are close to, but not exactly the same, as the original. Feel free to use the original dataset as part of this competition, both to explore differences as well as to see whether incorporating the original in training improves model performance.

Files  
- train.csv: the training dataset; smoking is the binary target  
- test.csv: the test dataset; your objective is to predict the probability of positive smoking  
- sample_submission.csv: a sample submission file in the correct format
