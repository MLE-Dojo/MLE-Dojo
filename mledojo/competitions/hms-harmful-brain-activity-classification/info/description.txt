### Description

In this competition, participants are tasked with automating the analysis of electroencephalography (EEG) data to detect and classify harmful brain activity, including seizures. Currently, EEG monitoring is a manual process performed by specialized neurologists, which is time-consuming and prone to errors. By developing algorithms to automate this analysis, competitors can significantly enhance the speed and accuracy of seizure detection, ultimately aiding in timely treatment and drug development.

The competition focuses on six key patterns: seizure (SZ), generalized periodic discharges (GPD), lateralized periodic discharges (LPD), lateralized rhythmic delta activity (LRDA), generalized rhythmic delta activity (GRDA), and “other.” EEG segments have been annotated by experts, with varying levels of agreement, categorized as idealized patterns, proto patterns, and edge cases.

### Evaluation

Submissions are evaluated on the Kullback Liebler divergence between the predicted probability and the observed target.

## Submission File

For each eeg_id in the test set, you must predict a probability for each of the vote columns. The file should contain a header and have the following format:

eeg_id,seizure_vote,lpd_vote,gpd_vote,lrda_vote,grda_vote,other_vote
  0,0.166,0.166,0.167,0.167,0.167,0.167
  1,0.166,0.166,0.167,0.167,0.167,0.167
  etc.

Your total predicted probabilities for each row must sum to one or your submission will fail.

### Dataset Description

The goal of this competition is to detect and classify seizures and other types of harmful brain activity in electroencephalography (EEG) data. Even experts find this to be a challenging task and often disagree about the correct labels.

This is a code competition. Only a few examples from the test set are available for download. When your submission is scored the test folders will be replaced with versions containing the complete test set.

### Files

train.csv Metadata for the train set. The expert annotators reviewed 50 second long EEG samples plus matched spectrograms covering 10 a minute window centered at the same time and labeled the central 10 seconds. Many of these samples overlapped and have been consolidated. train.csv provides the metadata that allows you to extract the original subsets that the raters annotated.

- eeg_id - A unique identifier for the entire EEG recording.
- eeg_sub_id - An ID for the specific 50 second long subsample this row's labels apply to.
- eeg_label_offset_seconds - The time between the beginning of the consolidated EEG and this subsample.
- spectrogram_id - A unique identifier for the entire EEG recording.
- spectrogram_sub_id - An ID for the specific 10 minute subsample this row's labels apply to.
- spectogram_label_offset_seconds - The time between the beginning of the consolidated spectrogram and this subsample.
- label_id - An ID for this set of labels.
- patient_id - An ID for the patient who donated the data.
- expert_consensus - The consensus annotator label. Provided for convenience only.
- [seizure/lpd/gpd/lrda/grda/other]_vote - The count of annotator votes for a given brain activity class. The full names of the activity classes are as follows: lpd: lateralized periodic discharges, gpd: generalized periodic discharges, lrd: lateralized rhythmic delta activity, and grda: generalized rhythmic delta activity. A detailed explanation of these patterns is available here.

test.csv Metadata for the test set. As there are no overlapping samples in the test set, many columns in the train metadata don't apply.

- eeg_id
- spectrogram_id
- patient_id

sample_submission.csv

- eeg_id
- [seizure/lpd/gpd/lrda/grda/other]_vote - The target columns. Your predictions must be probabilities. Note that the test samples had between 3 and 20 annotators.

train_eegs/ EEG data from one or more overlapping samples. Use the metadata in train.csv to select specific annotated subsets. The column names are the names of the individual electrode locations for EEG leads, with one exception. The EKG column is for an electrocardiogram lead that records data from the heart. All of the EEG data (for both train and test) was collected at a frequency of 200 samples per second.

test_eegs/ Exactly 50 seconds of EEG data.

train_spectrograms/ Spectrograms assembled from EEG data. Use the metadata in train.csv to select specific annotated subsets. The column names indicate the frequency in hertz and the recording regions of the EEG electrodes. The latter are abbreviated as LL = left lateral; RL = right lateral; LP = left parasagittal; RP = right parasagittal.

test_spectrograms/ Spectrograms assembled using exactly 10 minutes of EEG data.

example_figures/ Larger copies of the example case images used on the overview tab.

### Other Important Information

This competition is hosted by the Sunstella Foundation, which supports minority graduate students in technology. Participants are encouraged to leverage mentorship and resources provided by the foundation and its partners, including Persyst and Jazz Pharmaceuticals, to enhance their submissions.
