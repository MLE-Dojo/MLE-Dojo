Description  
Synthetically-Generated Datasets

Using synthetic data for Playground competitions allows us to strike a balance between having real-world data (with named features) and ensuring test labels are not publicly available. This allows us to host competitions with more interesting datasets than in the past. While there are still challenges with synthetic data generation, the state-of-the-art is much better now than when we started the Tabular Playground Series two years ago, and the goal is to produce datasets that have far fewer artifacts. Please feel free to give us feedback on the datasets for the different competitions so that we can continue to improve!

Evaluation  
Submissions are evaluated on micro-averaged F1-Score between predicted and actual values.

Submission File  
For each id in the test set, you must predict the corresponding outcome. The file should contain a header and have the following format:  

id,outcome  
1235,lived  
1236,lived  
1237,died  
etc.

Dataset Description  
The dataset for this competition (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model trained on a portion of the Horse Survival Dataset. Feature distributions are close to, but not exactly the same, as the original. Feel free to use the original dataset as part of this competition, both to explore differences as well as to see whether incorporating the original in training improves model performance. Good luck!

Files  
train.csv - the training dataset; outcome is the (categorical) target  
test.csv - the test dataset; your objective is to predict outcome  
sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format
