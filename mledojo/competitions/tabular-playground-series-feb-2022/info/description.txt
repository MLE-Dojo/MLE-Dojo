Description 

For the February 2022 Tabular Playground Series competition, your task is to classify 10 different bacteria species using data from a genomic analysis technique that has some data compression and data loss. In this technique, 10-mer snippets of DNA are sampled and analyzed to give the histogram of base count. In other words, the DNA segment `ATATGGCCTT` becomes `A 2 T 4 G 2 C 2`. Can you use this lossy information to accurately predict bacteria species?

About the Tabular Playground Series

Kaggle competitions are incredibly fun and rewarding, but they can also be intimidating for people who are relatively new in their data science journey. In the past, we've launched many Playground competitions that are more approachable than our Featured competitions and thus, more beginner-friendly.

The goal of these competitions is to provide a fun and approachable-for-anyone tabular dataset to model. These competitions are a great choice for people looking for something in between the Titanic Getting Started competition and the Featured competitions. If you're an established competitions master or grandmaster, these probably won't be much of a challenge for you; thus, we encourage you to avoid saturating the leaderboard.

For each monthly competition, we'll be offering Kaggle Merchandise for the top three teams. And finally, because we want these competitions to be more about learning, we're limiting team sizes to 3 individuals.

Getting Started

Good luck and have fun!

Dataset Description

For this challenge, you will be predicting bacteria species based on repeated lossy measurements of DNA snippets. Snippets of length 10 are analyzed using Raman spectroscopy that calculates the histogram of bases in the snippet. In other words, the DNA segment `ATATGGCCTT` becomes `A 2 T 4 G 2 C 2`.

Each row of data contains a spectrum of histograms generated by repeated measurements of a sample, each row containing the output of all 286 histogram possibilities (e.g., `A0 T0 G0 C10` to `A10 T0 G0 C0`), which then has a bias spectrum (of totally random ATGC) subtracted from the results.

The data (both train and test) also contains simulated measurement errors (of varying rates) for many of the samples, which makes the problem more challenging.

Files
- `train.csv` - the training set, which contains the spectrum of 10-mer histograms for each sample
- `test.csv` - the test set; your task is to predict the bacteria species (`target`) for each `row_id`
- `sample_submission.csv` - a sample submission file in the correct format
