Evaluation  
Submissions are evaluated using the accuracy score.

Submission File  
For each id row in the test set, you must predict the class value of the Target, which is a categorical academic risk assessment. The file should contain a header and have the following format:

id, Target  
76518, Graduate  
76519, Graduate  
76520, Graduate  
etc.

Dataset Description  
The dataset for this competition (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model trained on the Predict Students' Dropout and Academic Success dataset. Feature distributions are close to, but not exactly the same, as the original. Feel free to use the original dataset as part of this competition, both to explore differences as well as to see whether incorporating the original in training improves model performance. Please refer to the original dataset for feature explanations.
