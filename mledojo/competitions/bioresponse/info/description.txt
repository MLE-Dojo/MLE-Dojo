### Description

The competition aims to develop a robust model that correlates molecular information with actual biological responses. Participants will work with a dataset in CSV format, where each row represents a molecule. The first column indicates whether the molecule elicited a biological response (1) or not (0), while the subsequent columns (d1 through d1776) contain normalized molecular descriptors that capture various characteristics of the molecules, such as size, shape, and elemental composition.

### Evaluation

Predicted probabilities that a molecule elicits a response are evaluated using the log loss metric.

Log loss is defined as:

\text{log loss}=-\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^Ny_i\log\left(\hat{y_i}\right)+\left(1-y_i\right)\log\left(1-\hat{y_i}\right),

where \\(N\\) is the number of samples, 
\\(\text{log}\\) is the natural logarithm, \\(\hat{y_i}\\) is the posterior probability that the
\\(i^{th}\\) sample elicited a response, and
\\(y_i\\) is the ground truth 
(\\(y_i=1\\) means the molecule elicited a response, 
\\(y_i=0\\) means that it did not).

### Dataset Description

The data is in the comma separated values (CSV) format. Each row in this data set represents a molecule. The first column contains experimental data describing a real biological response; the molecule was seen to elicit this response (1), or not (0). The remaining columns represent molecular descriptors (d1 through d1776), which are calculated properties that can capture some of the characteristics of the molecule, such as size, shape, or elemental constitution. The descriptor matrix has been normalized.

### Files

The dataset is provided in a single CSV file containing the molecular data.
