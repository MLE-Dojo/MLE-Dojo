### Description

Welcome to the Dog Breed Identification competition! In this engaging playground challenge, you will utilize a canine subset of ImageNet to master fine-grained image categorization. Your task is to distinguish between 120 different dog breeds, from Norfolk Terriers to Norwich Terriers, using a limited number of training images per class. Can you rise to the challenge and accurately identify these furry friends?

### Evaluation

Submissions are evaluated on Multi Class Log Loss between the predicted probability and the observed target.

## Submission File

For each image in the test set, you must predict a probability for each of the different breeds. The file should contain a header and have the following format:

```
id,affenpinscher,afghan_hound,..,yorkshire_terrier
000621fb3cbb32d8935728e48679680e,0.0083,0.0,...,0.0083
etc.
```

### Dataset Description

You are provided with a training set and a test set of images of dogs, each identified by a unique filename. The dataset features 120 dog breeds, and your goal is to develop a classifier that can accurately determine a dog's breed from its photo. The breeds include:
