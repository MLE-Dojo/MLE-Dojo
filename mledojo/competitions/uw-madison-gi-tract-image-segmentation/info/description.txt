### Description

In 2019, approximately 5 million individuals were diagnosed with gastro-intestinal tract cancer globally, with around half qualifying for radiation therapy. This treatment typically spans 10-15 minutes daily over 1-6 weeks. Radiation oncologists aim to deliver high doses of radiation to tumors while sparing the stomach and intestines. With advanced technology like MR-Linacs, oncologists can visualize the daily positioning of tumors and surrounding organs, but the manual outlining of these areas is labor-intensive and time-consuming, often extending treatment times significantly. 

The UW-Madison Carbone Cancer Center, a leader in MR-Linac radiotherapy since 2015, is providing anonymized MRI scans of patients for this competition. Participants will develop a model to automate the segmentation of the stomach and intestines in these MRI scans, which are sourced from actual cancer patients undergoing treatment. By leveraging deep learning techniques, the goal is to enhance the efficiency of radiation therapy, allowing for higher doses to be safely administered to tumors while minimizing exposure to surrounding organs. Successful models will lead to faster treatments and improved patient outcomes.

### Evaluation

This competition is evaluated on the mean Dice coefficient and 3D Hausdorff distance. The Dice coefficient can be used to compare the pixel-wise agreement between a predicted segmentation and its corresponding ground truth. The formula is given by:

\frac{2 * |X \cap Y|}{|X| + |Y|},

where X is the predicted set of pixels and Y is the ground truth. The Dice coefficient is defined to be 0 when both X and Y are empty. The leaderboard score is the mean of the Dice coefficients for each image in the test set.

Hausdorff distance is a method for calculating the distance between segmentation objects A and B, by calculating the furthest point on object A from the nearest point on object B. For 3D Hausdorff, we construct 3D volumes by combining each 2D segmentation with slice depth as the Z coordinate and then find the Hausdorff distance between them. (In this competition, the slice depth for all scans is set to 1.) The scipy code for Hausdorff is linked. The expected / predicted pixel locations are normalized by image size to create a bounded 0-1 score.

The two metrics are combined, with a weight of 0.4 for the Dice metric and 0.6 for the Hausdorff distance.

### Submission File

In order to reduce the submission file size, our metric uses run-length encoding on the pixel values. Instead of submitting an exhaustive list of indices for your segmentation, you will submit pairs of values that contain a start position and a run length. E.g. '1 3' implies starting at pixel 1 and running a total of 3 pixels (1,2,3).

Note that, at the time of encoding, the mask should be binary, meaning the masks for all objects in an image are joined into a single large mask. A value of 0 should indicate pixels that are not masked, and a value of 1 will indicate pixels that are masked.

The competition format requires a space delimited list of pairs. For example, '1 3 10 5' implies pixels 1,2,3,10,11,12,13,14 are to be included in the mask. The metric checks that the pairs are sorted, positive, and the decoded pixel values are not duplicated. The pixels are numbered from top to bottom, then left to right: 1 is pixel (1,1), 2 is pixel (2,1), etc.

The file should contain a header and have the following format:

```
id,class,predicted
1,large_bowel,1 1 5 1
1,small_bowel,1 1
1,stomach,1 1
2,large_bowel,1 5 2 17
etc.
```

### Dataset Description

In this competition, we are segmenting organ cells in images. The training annotations are provided as RLE-encoded masks, and the images are in 16-bit grayscale PNG format.

Each case is represented by multiple sets of scan slices, identified by the day of the scan. Some cases are split by time (with early days in train and later days in test), while others are split by case (entirely in train or test). The goal is to generalize to both partially and wholly unseen cases.

The test set is entirely unseen, comprising roughly 50 cases with varying days and slices, similar to the training set.

### Files

- train.csv - IDs and masks for all training objects.
- sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format.
- train - a folder of case/day folders, each containing slice images for a particular case on a given day.

Note that the image filenames include 4 numbers (ex. 276_276_1.63_1.63.png). These four numbers represent slice width/height (integers in pixels) and width/height pixel spacing (floating points in mm). The first two define the resolution of the slide, while the last two record the physical size of each pixel.

Physical pixel thickness in the superior-inferior direction is 3mm.

## Columns

- id - unique identifier for the object
- class - the predicted class for the object
- segmentation - RLE-encoded pixels for the identified object

### Other Important Information

This is a Code Competition. Submissions must be made through Notebooks, with specific runtime limits and requirements for external data. The submission file must be named submission.csv.
