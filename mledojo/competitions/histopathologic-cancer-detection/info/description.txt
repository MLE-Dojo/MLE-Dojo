### Description

In this competition, participants are tasked with developing an algorithm to detect metastatic cancer in small image patches derived from larger digital pathology scans. The dataset used is a modified version of the PatchCamelyon (PCam) benchmark dataset, which has been adjusted to remove duplicate images present in the original due to probabilistic sampling. PCam is notable for its size, ease of use, and accessibility, making it an excellent resource for both beginners and experienced practitioners in the machine learning community.

### Evaluation

Submissions are evaluated on area under the ROC curve between the predicted probability and the observed target.

## Submission File

For each id in the test set, you must predict a probability that center 32x32px region of a patch contains at least one pixel of tumor tissue. The file should contain a header and have the following format:

```
id,label
0b2ea2a822ad23fdb1b5dd26653da899fbd2c0d5,0
95596b92e5066c5c52466c90b69ff089b39f2737,0
248e6738860e2ebcf6258cdc1f32f299e0c76914,0
etc.
```

### Dataset Description

This dataset consists of numerous small pathology images for classification. Each file is named with an image id, and the train_labels.csv file provides the ground truth for the images in the train folder. Participants will predict labels for the images in the test folder, where a positive label indicates that the center 32x32px region of a patch contains at least one pixel of tumor tissue. The outer region of the patch does not affect the label, allowing for the use of fully-convolutional models without zero-padding, ensuring consistent behavior when applied to whole-slide images. The Kaggle version of the PCam dataset maintains the same data and splits as the original benchmark while eliminating duplicates.
