### Description

In this competition, participants will tackle the critical issue of malpositioned catheters and lines in hospital patients, which can lead to serious complications. Despite the use of checklists by healthcare professionals, human error remains a risk, particularly in high-pressure environments. The challenge is to develop machine learning models that can automatically detect the presence and position of these tubes on chest x-rays, utilizing a dataset of 40,000 images. 

The dataset is categorized into three labels: "normal" for appropriately positioned lines, "borderline" for lines that may require repositioning but are still functional, and "abnormal" for lines that need immediate repositioning. Successful detection can significantly enhance patient safety, especially as the demand for such medical interventions rises during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

### Evaluation

Submissions are evaluated on area under the ROC curve between the predicted probability and the observed target.

To calculate the final score, AUC is calculated for each of the 11 labels, then averaged. The score is then the average of the individual AUCs of each predicted column.

## Submission File

For each ID in the test set, you must predict a probability for all target variables. The file should contain a header and have the following format:
