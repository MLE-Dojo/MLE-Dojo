### Description

The Plant Pathology Challenge addresses the critical issue of misdiagnosis in agricultural crop diseases, which can lead to increased costs and environmental harm. Traditional human scouting methods are inefficient and costly, while computer vision models face challenges due to the variability in symptoms caused by factors like tissue age, genetic differences, and lighting conditions. 

The competition aims to develop a model that can:
1. Accurately classify images of leaves into various disease categories or identify healthy leaves.
2. Distinguish between multiple diseases present on a single leaf.
3. Handle rare classes and novel symptoms effectively.
4. Address depth perception issues such as angle, light, shade, and leaf age.
5. Integrate expert knowledge for improved identification and feature extraction during model training.

### Evaluation

Submissions are evaluated on mean column-wise ROC AUC. In other words, the score is the average of the individual AUCs of each predicted column.

### Submission File

For each image_id in the test set, you must predict a probability for each target variable. The file should contain a header and have the following format:

```
image_id,healthy,multiple_diseases,rust,scab
test_0,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25
test_1,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25
test_2,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25
etc.
```

### Dataset Description

Given a photo of an apple leaf, can you accurately assess its health? This competition will challenge you to distinguish between leaves which are healthy, those which are infected with apple rust, those that have apple scab, and those with more than one disease.

### Other Important Information

This competition is part of the Fine-Grained Visual Categorization FGVC7 workshop at the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Conference CVPR 2020. A panel will review the top submissions based on the methods described, and selected teams may be invited to present their results at the workshop. Participation in the workshop is not mandatory, but only teams attending will be considered for presentation.
