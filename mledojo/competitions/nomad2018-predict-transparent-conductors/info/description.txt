### Description

The competition focuses on the innovative design of materials to address critical health, environmental, energy, social, and economic challenges. A key area of interest is the development of transparent conductors, which are essential for various technologies, including photovoltaic cells, LEDs, transistors, sensors, touch screens, and lasers. These materials must possess both electrical conductivity and low visible light absorption, yet only a limited number of compounds currently meet these criteria.

Promising candidates for transparent conductors include aluminum (Al), gallium (Ga), and indium (In) sesquioxides, known for their large bandgap energies and high conductivities. By alloying these binary compounds into ternary or quaternary mixtures, new materials with enhanced properties can be designed. However, the vast compositional space presents a challenge for discovering novel materials. Traditional methods, such as density-functional theory (DFT), are computationally expensive, limiting the exploration of potential compounds.

This competition invites participants to leverage data analytics, data mining, or machine learning techniques to predict two target properties: formation energy, which indicates material stability, and bandgap energy, which reflects potential transparency. The goal is to facilitate the discovery of new transparent conductors and advance related technologies.

### Evaluation

Submissions are evaluated on the column-wise root mean squared logarithmic error.

The RMSLE for a single column calculated as

\sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (\log(p_i + 1) - \log(a_i+1))^2 },

where:

\\(n\\) is the total number of observations \\(p_i\\) is your prediction\\(a_i\\) is the actual value \\(\log(x)\\) is the natural logarithm of \\(x\\)

The final score is the mean of the RMSLE over all columns (in this case, 2).

## Submission File

For each id in the test set, you must predict a value for both formation_energy_ev_natom and bandgap_energy_ev. The file should contain a header and have the following format:

```
id,formation_energy_ev_natom,bandgap_energy_ev
1,0.1779,1.8892
2,0.1779,1.8892
3,0.1779,1.8892
...
```

### Dataset Description

High-quality data are provided for 3,000 materials that show promise as transparent conductors. The following information has been included:

- Spacegroup (a label identifying the symmetry of the material)
- Total number of Al, Ga, In and O atoms in the unit cell (N_{total})
- Relative compositions of Al, Ga, and In (x, y, z)
- Lattice vectors and angles: lv1, lv2, lv3 (which are lengths given in units of angstroms (10^{-10} meters) and α, β, γ (which are angles in degrees between 0° and 360°)

A domain expert will understand the physical meaning of the above information but those with a data mining background may simply use the data as input for their models.

The task for this competition is to predict two target properties:

- Formation energy (an important indicator of the stability of a material)
- Bandgap energy (an important property for optoelectronic applications)

## File Descriptions

Note: For each line of the CSV file, the corresponding spatial positions of all of the atoms in the unit cell (expressed in Cartesian coordinates) are provided as a separate file.

train.csv - contains a set of materials for which the bandgap and formation energies are provided

test.csv - contains the set of materials for which you must predict the bandgap and formation energies

/{train|test}/{id}/geometry.xyz - files with spatial information about the material. The file name corresponds to the id in the respective csv files.

### Other Important Information

Participants are encouraged to utilize data-driven models to efficiently search for new compounds, significantly reducing computational costs compared to traditional methods.
