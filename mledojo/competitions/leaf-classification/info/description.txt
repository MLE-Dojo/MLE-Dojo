### Description

Join this exciting playground competition aimed at accurately identifying 99 species of plants using binary leaf images and extracted features such as shape, margin, and texture. With nearly half a million plant species worldwide, classification has historically faced challenges, often leading to duplicate identifications. Leaves serve as an effective means of differentiation due to their unique characteristics and prevalence. 

Participants are encouraged to first build a classifier using the provided pre-extracted features, then create their own features, and finally analyze their errors to enhance their models. This competition not only offers a fun way to apply image-based techniques but also serves as a valuable educational experience.

### Evaluation

Submissions are evaluated using the multi-class logarithmic loss. Each image has been labeled with one true species. For each image, you must submit a set of predicted probabilities (one for every species). The formula is then,

log loss = -\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N\sum_{j=1}^My_{ij}\log(p_{ij}),

where N is the number of images in the test set, M is the number of species labels, \\(log\\) is the natural logarithm, \\(y_{ij}\\) is 1 if observation \\(i\\) is in class \\(j\\) and 0 otherwise, and \\(p_{ij}\\) is the predicted probability that observation \\(i\\) belongs to class \\(j\\).

The submitted probabilities for a given device are not required to sum to one because they are rescaled prior to being scored (each row is divided by the row sum), but they need to be in the range of [0, 1]. In order to avoid the extremes of the log function, predicted probabilities are replaced with \\(max(min(p,1-10^{-15}),10^{-15})\\).

## Submission File

You must submit a csv file with the image id, all candidate species names, and a probability for each species. The order of the rows does not matter. The file must have a header and should look like the following:

```
id,Acer_Capillipes,Acer_Circinatum,Acer_Mono,...
2,0.1,0.5,0,0.2,...
5,0,0.3,0,0.4,...
6,0,0,0,0.7,...
etc.
```

### Dataset Description

The dataset consists of approximately 1,584 images of leaf specimens (16 samples each of 99 species) converted to binary black leaves against white backgrounds. Three sets of features are provided per image: a shape contiguous descriptor, an interior texture histogram, and a fine-scale margin histogram. Each feature includes a 64-attribute vector per leaf sample. Note that one species has been eliminated due to incomplete associated data.

### Files

- train.csv - the training set
- test.csv - the test set
- sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format
- images - the image files (each image is named with its corresponding id)

### Data fields

- id - an anonymous id unique to an image
- margin_1, margin_2, margin_3, ..., margin_64 - each of the 64 attribute vectors for the margin feature
- shape_1, shape_2, shape_3, ..., shape_64 - each of the 64 attribute vectors for the shape feature
- texture_1, texture_2, texture_3, ..., texture_64 - each of the 64 attribute vectors for the texture feature
