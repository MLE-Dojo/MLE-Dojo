### Description

The "Don't Get Kicked!" competition addresses a significant challenge faced by auto dealerships when purchasing used cars at auctions: the risk of acquiring vehicles with serious issues, commonly referred to as "kicks." These problematic purchases can arise from tampered odometers, unresolved mechanical issues, title complications, or other unforeseen problems, leading to substantial costs for dealers due to transportation fees, ineffective repairs, and losses during resale. Participants in this competition are tasked with predicting whether a car bought at auction is a kick (bad buy), providing valuable insights to dealerships aiming to optimize their inventory selection.
