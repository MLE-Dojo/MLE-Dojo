### Description

Join the Metropolitan Museum of Art's challenge to identify significant attributes of its vast collection, which includes over 1.5 million objects, with more than 200,000 digitized images. This competition invites participants to enhance the understanding of artworks by adding fine-grained attributes that facilitate the search for visually related objects. The dataset comprises extensive online cataloging information generated by subject matter experts, covering various aspects such as object classifications, artist details, title, period, date, medium, culture, size, provenance, and geographic location. This is a Code Competition, and participants should refer to the Code Requirements for further details.

### Evaluation

Submissions will be evaluated based on their micro averaged F1 score.

### Dataset Description

This dataset features a large collection of artwork images along with their associated attributes. It has been expanded from the previous year's competition and includes various modalities, though the camera sources are unknown. Images are typically centered on objects, and scenic images are provided for entire rooms. Each object is annotated by a single annotator without verification, who used an ontology from The Met and could add free-form text. While efforts were made to ensure high-quality attribute labels, participants should be aware that the annotations may contain noise, with some attributes potentially having similar meanings. The competition metric, F2 score, was selected to provide robustness against these noisy labels, prioritizing recall over precision. This is a synchronous-rerun competition, meaning submitted code will be executed on a private test set with unseen images.

### Files

The filename of each image is its id.

- train.csv gives the attribute_ids for the train images in /train
- /test contains the test images. You must predict the attribute_ids for these images.
- sample_submission.csv contains a submission in the correct format
- labels.csv provides descriptions of the attributes

### Other Important Information

This competition is part of the FGVC7 workshop at CVPR 2020. Submissions must be made through Notebooks, and specific conditions apply regarding runtime and data access. Only teams attending the workshop may be invited to present their results.
