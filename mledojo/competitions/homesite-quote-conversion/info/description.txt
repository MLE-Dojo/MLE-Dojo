In the competitive world of homeowners insurance, understanding the likelihood of a customer converting a quote into a purchase is crucial. Homesite, a prominent provider in this sector, currently lacks a dynamic model to predict conversion rates effectively. They invite you to leverage an anonymized dataset of customer and sales activity to forecast which customers are likely to accept a given quote. By accurately predicting these conversions, Homesite aims to refine their pricing strategies and optimize their customer portfolio.
