**Description**

Kaggle competitions are incredibly fun and rewarding, but they can also be intimidating for people who are relatively new in their data science journey. In the past, we've launched many Playground competitions that are more approachable than our Featured competitions and thus, more beginner-friendly. In order to have a more consistent offering of these competitions for our community, we're trying a new experiment in 2021. We'll be launching month-long tabular Playground competitions on the 1st of every month and continue the experiment as long as there's sufficient interest and participation. 

The goal of these competitions is to provide a fun, and approachable for anyone, tabular dataset. These competitions will be great for people looking for something in between the Titanic Getting Started competition and a Featured competition. If you're an established competitions master or grandmaster, these probably won't be much of a challenge for you. We encourage you to avoid saturating the leaderboard. 

For each monthly competition, we'll be offering Kaggle Merchandise for the top three teams. And finally, because we want these competitions to be more about learning, we're limiting team sizes to 3 individuals. 

The dataset used for this competition is synthetic, but based on a real dataset and generated using a CTGAN. The original dataset deals with predicting identifying spam emails via various extracted features from the email. Although the features are anonymized, they have properties relating to real-world features. 

Good luck and have fun!

**Evaluation**

Submissions are evaluated on area under the ROC curve between the predicted probability and the observed target. 

**Submission File**

For each id in the test set, you must predict a probability for the target variable. The file should contain a header and have the following format:
```
id,target  
600000,0.5  
600001,0.9  
600002,0.1  
etc.
```

**Dataset Description**

For this competition, you will be predicting a binary target based on 100 feature columns given in the data. All columns are continuous. The data is synthetically generated by a GAN that was trained on a real-world dataset used to identify spam emails via various extracted features from the email. 

**Files**

- `train.csv` - the training data with the target column
- `test.csv` - the test set; you will be predicting the target for each row in this file (the probability of the binary target)
- `sample_submission.csv` - a sample submission file in the correct format
