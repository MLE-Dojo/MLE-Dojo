### Description

Whale populations, after centuries of whaling, face challenges in adapting to warming oceans and competing with industrial fishing for food. To support conservation efforts, scientists utilize photo surveillance systems to monitor ocean activity, identifying whale species through their unique tail shapes and markings. Historically, this identification has been a manual process, leaving vast amounts of data underutilized.

In this competition, participants are tasked with developing an algorithm to identify whale species from images. You will work with Happy Whaleâ€™s extensive database of over 25,000 images collected from research institutions and public contributors. Your contributions will enhance our understanding of marine mammal population dynamics globally.

We extend our gratitude to Happy Whale for providing this valuable data and problem. Happy Whale is a platform that employs image processing algorithms to allow users to submit whale photos for automatic identification.

### Evaluation

Submissions are evaluated according to the Mean Average Precision @ 5 (MAP@5):

MAP@5 = \frac{1}{U} \sum_{u=1}^{U}  \sum_{k=1}^{min(n,5)} P(k)

where U is the number of images, P(k) is the precision at cutoff k, and n is the number predictions per image.

## Submission File

For each Image in the test set, you may predict up to 5 labels for the whale Id. Whales that are not predicted to be one of the labels in the training data should be labeled as new_whale. The file should contain a header and have the following format:

```
Image,Id 
00029b3a.jpg,new_whale w_1287fbc w_98baff9 w_7554f44 w_1eafe46
0003c693.jpg,new_whale w_1287fbc w_98baff9 w_7554f44 w_1eafe46
...
```

## Dataset Description

This training data contains thousands of images of humpback whale flukes. Individual whales have been identified by researchers and given an Id. The challenge is to predict the whale Id of images in the test set. What makes this such a challenge is that there are only a few examples for each of 3,000+ whale Ids.

## File descriptions

- train/ - a folder containing the training images
- train.csv - maps the training Image to the appropriate whale Id. Whales that are not predicted to have a label identified in the training data should be labeled as new_whale.
- test/ - a folder containing the test images to predict the whale Id
- sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format
