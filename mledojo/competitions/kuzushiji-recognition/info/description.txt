### Description

Join the quest to unlock the secrets of Japan's rich literary history by building a model that transcribes ancient Kuzushiji into contemporary Japanese characters. With millions of historical documents, including personal letters and diaries, much of this knowledge remains inaccessible to modern readers due to the cursive writing style known as Kuzushiji, which has only 0.01% fluent readers today. The Center for Open Data in the Humanities (CODH) seeks machine learning experts to enhance algorithms for Kuzushiji recognition, making these invaluable texts more accessible and paving the way for new discoveries in Japanese culture and history.

### Evaluation

Submissions are evaluated on a modified version of the F1 Score. To score a true positive, you must provide center point coordinates that are within the ground truth bounding box and a matching label. The ground truth bounding boxes are defined in the format {label X Y Width Height}, so if the ground truth label is U+003F 1 1 10 10 then a prediction of U+003F 3 3 would pass. You can find a Python version of the metric here.

## Submission File

For each image in the test set, you must locate and identify all of the kuzushiji characters. Not every image will necessarily be scored. The file should contain a header and have the following format:

```
image_id,labels
image_id,{label X Y} {...}
```

Do not make more than 1,200 predictions per page.

### Dataset Description

Kuzushiji is a cursive script that was used in Japan for over a thousand years that has fallen out of use in modern times. Vast portions of Japanese historical documents now cannot be read by most Japanese people. By helping to automate the transcription of kuzushiji you will contribute to unlocking a priceless trove of books and records.

The specific task is to locate and classify each kuzushiji character on a page. While complete bounding boxes are provided for the training set, only a single point within the ground truth bounding box is needed for submissions.

There are a few important things to keep in mind for your submissions:

- Some images only contain illustrations, in which case no labels should be submitted for the page.
- Kuzushiji text is written such that annotations are placed between the columns of the main text, usually in a slightly smaller font. See the characters with no bounding boxes in this image for examples. The annotation characters should be ignored; labels for them will be scored as false positives.
- You can occasionally see through especially thin paper and read characters from the opposite side of the page. Those characters should also be ignored.

### Files

- train.csv - the training set labels and bounding boxes.
image_id: the id code for the image.
labels: a string of all labels for the image. The string should be read as space separated series of values where Unicode character, X, Y, Width, and Height are repeated as many times as necessary.
- sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format.
image_id: the id code for the image
labels: a string of all labels for the image. The string should be read as space separated series of values where Unicode character, X, and Y are repeated as many times as necessary. The default label predicts that there are the same two characters on every page, centered at pixels (1,1) and (2,2).
- unicode_translation.csv - supplemental file mapping between unicode IDs and Japanese characters.
- [train/test]_images.zip - the images.

### Other Important Information

Participants are encouraged to familiarize themselves with the unique challenges of Kuzushiji recognition, including the large number of character types, variations in Hiragana, and the connectedness of characters in cursive writing.
