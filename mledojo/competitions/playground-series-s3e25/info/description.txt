Evaluation  
Submissions are scored on the Median Absolute Error (MedAE). MedAE is defined as:  
MedAE(y, ŷ) = median(|yi - ŷi|, … , |yn - ŷn|)  
where ŷi is the predicted value and yi is the ground truth for each observation i.

Submission File  
For each id row in the test set, you must predict the value for the target Hardness. The file should contain a header and have the following format:  
id, Hardness  
10407, 4.647  
10408, 4.647  
10409, 4.647  
etc.

Dataset Description  
The dataset for this competition (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model trained on the Prediction of Mohs Hardness with Machine Learning dataset. Feature distributions are close to, but not exactly the same, as the original. Feel free to use the original dataset as part of this competition, both to explore differences as well as to see whether incorporating the original in training improves model performance.

Files  
train.csv - the training dataset; Hardness is the continuous target  
test.csv - the test dataset; your objective is to predict the value of Hardness
