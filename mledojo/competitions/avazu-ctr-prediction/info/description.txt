### Description

In the realm of online advertising, click-through rate (CTR) serves as a crucial metric for assessing ad performance, making click prediction systems vital for sponsored search and real-time bidding. This competition invites participants to utilize 11 days of Avazu data to develop and evaluate prediction models. The challenge lies in devising a strategy that surpasses standard classification algorithms. Winning models will be released under an open-source license.

### Evaluation

Submissions are evaluated using the Logarithmic Loss (smaller is better).

## Submission File
