Description  
Kaggle competitions are incredibly fun and rewarding, but they can also be intimidating for people who are relatively new in their data science journey. In the past, we've launched many Playground competitions that are more approachable than our Featured competitions and thus, more beginner-friendly. 

In order to have a more consistent offering of these competitions for our community, we're trying a new experiment in 2021. We'll be launching month-long tabular Playground competitions on the 1st of every month and continue the experiment as long as there's sufficient interest and participation. 

The goal of these competitions is to provide a fun, and approachable for anyone, tabular dataset. These competitions will be great for people looking for something in between the Titanic Getting Started competition and a Featured competition. If you're an established competitions master or grandmaster, these probably won't be much of a challenge for you. We encourage you to avoid saturating the leaderboard. 

For each monthly competition, we'll be offering Kaggle Merchandise for the top three teams. And finally, because we want these competitions to be more about learning, we're limiting team sizes to 3 individuals. 

The dataset used for this competition is based on a real dataset but has synthetic-generated aspects to it. The original dataset deals with predicting air pollution in a city via various input sensor values (e.g., a time series). 

Good luck and have fun! For ideas on how to improve your score, check out the Intro to Machine Learning and Intermediate Machine Learning courses on Kaggle Learn.

Evaluation  
Submissions are evaluated using the mean column-wise root mean squared logarithmic error. 

The RMSLE for a single column calculated as: 
\[ \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (\log(p_i + 1) - \log(a_i+1))^2 }\] 

where:  
- \( n \) is the total number of observations 
- \( p_i \) is your prediction 
- \( a_i \) is the actual value 
- \( \log(x) \) is the natural logarithm of \( x \)

The final score is the mean of the RMSLE over all columns, in this case, 3.

Submission File  
For each ID in the test set, you must predict a probability for the TARGET variable. The file should contain a header and have the following format:  

```
date_time,target_carbon_monoxide,target_benzene,target_nitrogen_oxides
2011-01-01 01:00:00,2.0,10.0,300.0 
2011-01-01 02:00:00,2.0,10.0,300.0 
2011-01-01 03:00:00,2.0,10.0,300.0 
...
```

Dataset Description  
In this competition, you are predicting the values of air pollution measurements over time, based on basic weather information (temperature and humidity) and the input values of 5 sensors. 

The three target values to you to predict are:  
- target_carbon_monoxide 
- target_benzene 
- target_nitrogen_oxides

Files  
- train.csv - the training data, including the weather data, sensor data, and values for the 3 targets.
- test.csv - the same format as train.csv, but without the target value; your task is to predict the value for each of these targets.
- sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format.
