### Description

Join the StumbleUpon Evergreen Classification Challenge, where your task is to develop a classifier that distinguishes between "ephemeral" and "evergreen" web content. StumbleUpon, a user-curated web content discovery engine, aims to enhance its recommendation system by predicting the longevity of web pages based on user interests. While some content is only relevant for a short time, others remain valuable indefinitely. Your challenge is to analyze a large set of URLs and accurately label them as either evergreen or ephemeral. A successful model could not only improve StumbleUpon's recommendations but also open doors to a potential internship at a top San Francisco company.

### Evaluation

Submissions are judged on area under the ROC curve.

In Matlab (using the stats toolbox):

```
[~, ~, ~, auc ] = perfcurve(true_labels, predictions, 1);
```

In R (using the verification package):

```
auc = roc.area(true_labels, predictions)
```

In python (using the metrics module of scikit-learn):

```
fpr, tpr, thresholds = metrics.roc_curve(true_labels, predictions, pos_label=1)
auc = metrics.auc(fpr,tpr)
```

## Submission Format

Each line of your submission should contain an urlid and a label. Note that you may submit any real-valued number as a prediction, since AUC is only sensitive to the ranking. sampleSubmission.csv shows a representative valid submission. The format looks like this:

```
urlid,label
5865,0
782,0
6962,0
etc...
```

### Dataset Description

Note: researchers who wish to use this data outside the competition should download and read the data access agreement.

There are two components to the data provided for this challenge:

The first component is two files: train.tsv and test.tsv. Each is a tab-delimited text file containing the fields outlined below for 10,566 urls total. Fields for which no data is available are indicated with a question mark.

- train.tsv is the training set and contains 7,395 urls. Binary evergreen labels (either evergreen (1) or non-evergreen (0)) are provided for this set.
- test.tsv is the test/evaluation set and contains 3,171 urls.

The second component is raw_content.zip, a zip file containing the raw content for each url, as seen by StumbleUpon's crawler. Each url's raw content is stored in a tab-delimited text file, named with the urlid as indicated in train.tsv and test.tsv.

The following table includes field descriptions for train.tsv and test.tsv:

| FieldName | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| url | string | Url of the webpage to be classified |
| urlid | integer | StumbleUpon's unique identifier for each url |
| boilerplate | json | Boilerplate text |
| alchemy_category | string | Alchemy category (per the publicly available Alchemy API found at www.alchemyapi.com) |
| alchemy_category_score | double | Alchemy category score (per the publicly available Alchemy API found at www.alchemyapi.com) |
| avglinksize | double | Average number of words in each link |
| commonLinkRatio_1 | double | # of links sharing at least 1 word with 1 other links / # of links |
| commonLinkRatio_2 | double | # of links sharing at least 1 word with 2 other links / # of links |
| commonLinkRatio_3 | double | # of links sharing at least 1 word with 3 other links / # of links |
| commonLinkRatio_4 | double | # of links sharing at least 1 word with 4 other links / # of links |
| compression_ratio | double | Compression achieved on this page via gzip (measure of redundancy) |
| embed_ratio | double | Count of number of <embed> usage |
| frameBased | integer (0 or 1) | A page is frame-based (1) if it has no body markup but have a frameset markup |
| frameTagRatio | double | Ratio of iframe markups over total number of markups |
| hasDomainLink | integer (0 or 1) | True (1) if it contains an <a> with an url with domain |
| html_ratio | double | Ratio of tags vs text in the page |
| image_ratio | double | Ratio of <img> tags vs text in the page |
| is_news | integer (0 or 1) | True (1) if StumbleUpon's news classifier determines that this webpage is news |
| lengthyLinkDomain | integer (0 or 1) | True (1) if at least 3 <a>'s text contains more than 30 alphanumeric characters |
| linkwordscore | double | Percentage of words on the page that are in hyperlink's text |
| news_front_page | integer (0 or 1) | True (1) if StumbleUpon's news classifier determines that this webpage is front-page news |
| non_markup_alphanum_characters | integer | Page's text's number of alphanumeric characters |
| numberOfLinks | integer | Number of <a> markups |
| numwords_in_url | double | Number of words in url |
| parametrizedLinkRatio | double | A link is parametrized if it's url contains parameters or has an attached onClick event |
| spelling_errors_ratio | double | Ratio of words not found in wiki (considered to be a spelling mistake) |
| label | integer (0 or 1) | User-determined label. Either evergreen (1) or non-evergreen (0); available for train.tsv only |
